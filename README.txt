I used D3 v4 for this, python server to host everything locally,
All libs are downloaded.
index.html is the primary file.

* I only tested this in Chrome *

Sketches are in the sketch folder. Along with text that was submitted in the first write up.


Aside:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, v3 stuff is different enough from v4, that I did not get the hang of a lot of this till 3 nights of 
working with it.

PS, thanks for having a first assignment that wasn't group work, this has been an eye opener for what kind of work we 
will be doing. Some of this is a lot harder than I thought it would be (mostly versions and drawing your own shapes 
to the screen is annoying).
