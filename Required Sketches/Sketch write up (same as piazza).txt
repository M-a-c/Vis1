I collected sentiment, time, intent [question, answer, statement, other] and if an email was sent or received. I used a website to calculate the sentiment of emails, and referred to my inbox from when i got or sent the emails. There is a reason I am doing the data based off my email. I am the president of an organization at UIC and I want to see if there are certain trends in the emails I’m receiving and the ones I’m sending. This is the first time in my life where email is a big part of my day. I’m curious to see the trends. Maybe I can dig back to the types of emails I got last year and use the same tool to analyze how this position has changed my daily routine.
 
 
 
The first graph here is to chart the date of email along with the happiness in the email.
The emails as svg’s should be clickable, and cause the Next graph to change with that day's information being displayed.

 This second graph shows the breakdown of individual emails in a day, by type. When a user clicks on its sub data that section will become highlighted and shown on the first chart, exclusively the data of that type. If a user had clicked a specific day, it will then lock to that day and show that data. Resetting the graph is described below.

 As a side note, clicking anywhere off the graphs will cause all the data to return back to its resting state displaying all days, with all information.
